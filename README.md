# Real-Time Fraud Detection API 🛡️

A production-ready Machine Learning inference service designed to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time. This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps workflow: from training a model on imbalanced data to deploying it as a containerized microservice.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **High-Performance Inference:** Built with **FastAPI** for low-latency response times (<50ms).
* **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Utilizes **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance in fraud datasets.
* **Robust Model:** Trained using **RandomForest/XGBoost** for high precision.
* **Production-Ready:** Containerized with **Docker** for consistent deployment across environments.
* **Type Safety:** Uses **Pydantic** for strict input data validation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.9
* **Framework:** FastAPI, Uvicorn
* **ML Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE), Joblib
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Tools:** Git, Swagger UI
